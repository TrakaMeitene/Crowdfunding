Poject provides the posibillity for a user to open a modal w=indow eher to shoose how much to pledge. 
Ther's an apportunity not to pledge with a summ of money, but support it by subscribing to news - I've made the email input as a bonus. 

As well, after every pledge submit, it count +1 to total backers. As the summ rises, the total backed summ is displayed.
